            <p class="copy">The Curious Incident of the Dog at Nighttime follows the journey of Christopher discovering who murdered Mrs. Shears’ dog. Along the way he learns who he can and cannot trust and discovers the truth about his mother’s fate. I wanted to show the process of Christopher solving the mystery as reflected through the puzzle pieces in the background. As he comes closer to discovering the truth, more puzzle pieces fall off revealing hidden layers to the mystery. Once he catches the murderer and all the pieces are gone, letters from his “dead” mother are revealed showing why she really left. As Christopher solves the new mystery of finding his mother, a new puzzle piece is being assembled in the background, emphasizing his growth as a person. I took inspiration from the 1950s retro futurism aesthetic due to Christopher’s fascination with space, with the three platforms to looks like planets that connect by a road.
