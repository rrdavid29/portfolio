            <h2>Bainer Hall Interior Survey & Renovation</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-03">March 2023</time>
            <p class="material">TwinMotion, Vectorworks, Adobe Premiere Pro</p>
            <p class="copy">I drafted and rendered a 3D model of the Bainer Hall lobby at the University of California, Davis - the department building for Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and the home for the Civil Engineering laboratories. After, I created a short animation highlighting the space and the changes I implemented.</p>

                <h3>Interior Survey</h3>
                <p>I started the process by collecting measurements and pictures of the space so that I could draft the building in Vectorworks. I used graph paper and rough estimation of the space that would give me an outline of the important features I needed to measure. Because of this, the drafts are not to scale, however, it gave me a better understanding of the space.</p>

                <h3>Renovation</h3>
                <p>Bainer Hall is named after Roy Bainer, the founding dean of the College of Engineering at UC Davis. WIth the renovation, I wanted to keep its history to engineering, as well, as keeping the space as a study center for students to come. Bainer Hall utilized burgundy woods, cream tile flooring, and grey detailing. I renovated the space so that it matched the new guidelines UC Davis follows for its newer buildings, focusing on light timber, light grey tile flooring, and bright accent colors.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>After completing this project, I learned how detailed I need to be when conducting an interior survey. I found myself having to take measurements of minute details that most individuals would not pay attention to. However, these small details are important when completing an interior survey as it makes the model feel more realistic and true to the existing building. With this being the most tedious part, I ofund it to be the most important and most challenging. Because I needed to pay attention to details such as how far away the fire alarm was from the window, I spent a lot of time in the existing building measuring. I am most proud of the animation I created as this was my first time using TwinMotion and Adobe Premiere Pro. It taught me how creating a 3D render of a building can elevate your design and offer a new tool to show clients your ideas.</p>
