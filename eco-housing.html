                <p>My partner and I co-designed a co-housing living experience on a plot of land in Village Homes in Davis, California. Co-housing communities are intentional shared communities with private residences and shared community spaces. Together, the two of us designed a community space that met the requirements of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>400 - 600 s.f. (min./max.)</li>
                    <li>ADA Accessible</li>
                    <li>50% shade</li>
                    <li>No full enclosure requiring doors allowed</li>
                    <li>Provides shareable space for community at large to do at least two the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make / Create</li>
                            <li>Interact / Engage</li>
                            <li>View / Gather</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>    

                <p>After dividing the piece of land to accommodate two separate houses, we individually designed a residential space that would meet the needs of the community. Each residential space was required to meet the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1200-1600 s.f. (min./max.)</li>
                    <li>2-storey max. (~800 s.f. per floor)</li>
                    <li>2-3 bedrooms
                        <ul>
                            <li>1-2 rooms may be non-bedroom (Ex.: office, studio)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>1-1½ bathroom</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Exploration</h3>
                <p>In order to find the essential aspects of the co-housing lifestyle, my partner and I researched existing co-housing communities in the United States. This would later help us to create our site plan and divide the space to fulfill the needs of co-housing communities. We created five iterations of site plans that would promote community in the space, each utilizing the land in different ways. We eventually decided on using the plan that had the community space in the center, with the residential spaces surrounding.</p>

                <p>After co-designing with another designer, I was left to design one of the two residential spaces going on the land. I used parti diagrams and blocking exercises to understand how I wanted the space to function without worrying about the actual dimensions of the rooms. I wanted to focus on the shape representing the emphasis of the room. With this I found one iteration that appealed to the ideas of sustainability, flexibility and being one with nature, with the residential space wrapping around a garden. With this iteration, I utilized an exercise that emphasized the building's connection to nature with the dark green being having a bigger connection and light green having a smaller connection.</p>

                <h3>Revision</h3>
                <p>The original iteration had the residential space wrap fully enclose the exterior garden, however, by doing that, I limited the amount of space of the interior with the only way of expanding resulting in a smaller garden. As a result, I designed the space to be a U-shape which would still allow all sides of the house to have sight on the center garden, but allowed for more space on the inside for greater flexibility.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>After completing this project, I learned how to design a co-housing community and the importance of site planning during an architecture project. Although the class did not cover all of the design requirements architects need to follow, I learned about basic design restrictions such as door measurements, necessary dimensions for means of egress, window placements, etc. in order to ensure all individuals can inhabit the space. I am most proud of space’s solutions towards adaptability through its bifold doors on the first floor and the retractable doors on the second floor. I believe it allows the inhabitants to change the space based on their needs and allows them to have the connection to nature that the community desires.</p>
